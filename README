=> USAGE

  program ConsoleTest;
  
  {$APPTYPE CONSOLE}
  
  uses
    SysUtils,
    PLDelphi_dll ;
  
  var
    browser , response : SV ;
      
  begin
  
    Perl.use('WWW::Mechanize');
  
    browser := Perl.NEW('WWW::Mechanize');
  
    response := browser.call_sv('get',' "http://www.perl.com/" ') ;

=> BUILD/INSTALL

First install Delphi and Perl binaries.

You also will need to have Perl binaries in the search PATH:

  PATH=C:\Perl\bin\;%PATH%

After have the binaries well installed just type:

  Perl MakeFile.PL
  nmake

Then you should compile the ConsoleTest test project in Delphi (ConsoleTest.dpr).
After this you are able to run the B<ConsoleTest.exe> example.

I<Note that after build PLDelphi you will have a I<./built> directory with all the
files needed to be with your Delphi application. In this directory you also will
have the I<ConsoleTest.exe> example to test it in this directory.>

I<Note that maybe you will need to copy by hand Perl56.dll to the I<./built> directory
to have full standalone version of PLDelphi (without the need to install Perl).>

Enjoy!

=> Delphi package:

To use PLDelphi from your Delphi application without need to install Perl you
will need this files in the main diretory of your application:

  PLDelphi.dll     ## The PLDelphi library that loads the Perl interpreter.
  PLDelphi.pm      ## Perl side of PLDelphi.
  Perl56.dll       ## The Perl library in case that you have Perl built dynamic.
  PLDelphi_dll.pas ## PLDelphi classes and DLL wrapper.
  lib/*            ## A Perl lib directory with basic .pm files (strict, warnings, etc...)

I<Take a look in the ./built directory after build PLDelphi.>

=> Win32

You will need to have VC++ 6 to compile PLDelphi, since your Perl version for Win32 (from ActiveState)
will be probably compiled with VC++, and we need the same compiler of the interpreter
to embed a Perl program.

=> Linux

I haven't ported it to Linux yet. Help welcome!

=> Threads

Note that if you are compiling PLDelphi with Perl 5.8+ you can use Perl Threads too.
